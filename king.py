"""
Chess king moves horizontally, vertically or diagonally to any adjacent cell. 
Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a king can go 
from the first cell to the second in one move.
The program receives the input of four numbers from 1 to 8, each
specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first cell, and 
then the last two - for the second cell. The program should output YES if a king
can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.

x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
if abs(x1 - x2) <= 1 and abs(y1 - y2) <= 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
